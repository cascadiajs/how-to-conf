#Let's talk about talks! 

Reminder #1: slides are due by 5pm, [date] to [person/email] for review. This can be either a file emailed or a link to a url. 

I recognize that both of these methods mean you are able to tweak things after you've turned them into me. No worries! I am checking for CoC violations, typos, and whether it works on-site as planned. Running through 12 talks the morning of each event will be logistically challenging, so I hope to be able to test them on arrival to the venue. 

Speaking of talk-by-talk logistics, I need to know what's happening in your talk! Is it just a 'walk up on stage, smile, talk, click through slides, wave' or is it more of a 'talk, live demo, show a video, do some crazy interaction, ask the audience a question, get a participant up on stage' type deal? I need to know all of this. Please. Go HERE to share that info with us if you haven’t already.

##Day-of

The conditions to expect on the day-of:

We have split the schedule into 3-talk sections and ask that you report to the speaker green room 10 minutes before the start of the block that you're speaking in. We'll have a speaker wrangler running around to nab you and make sure you're where you need to be. They will hang out with you, making sure everything is running smoothly. 

We will have you mic'ed up to a wireless earpiece 10 minutes prior at the AV booth. You'll then be shown by our speaker wrangler where/how to approach the stage.  When it's your turn, you'll be ushered on stage as the emcee is introducing you. We’ll plug in your laptop, make sure the display is ready to switch the feed from a filler screen to your presentation, and have the emcee finish the intro. You'll have a clicker to advance slides.

##Stage & slides

Our projectors will adjust to whatever the laptop or tablet is putting out to up to 1080p or 1920x1080. 1080p is pretty standard now.

​Strong contrast between background and fonts are strongly encouraged for proper color balance in the videos and ease of attendee viewing.

We will have a spare laptop you can present on in case of a computer meltdown. 

There will be a very large screen on each side of you lit by big bright projectors.

You will have a timer.

You will have an earpiece mic and an optional a remote clicker and so that you can move on the whole stage, but ​moving around​ is not required.

WiFi ​will be available to speakers, ​but as always, play it safe and ​please plan for offline backups.

Clothes to avoid for the videos: small stripes and black.

##Content guidelines 

Our emcees will introduce you properly before you come on stage so you can remove the usual first slide presenting yourself and go straight to your content.

*Your talk should not [exceed 25 minutes]. *

As a reminder, our audience dislikes product pitches and it is in your best interest to avoid promoting any commercial product and focus on content. 

Specifically:

* No “We are hiring” (everybody is, anyway). You’re welcome to talk to people while attending the conference and tell them this.

* Please remove headers/footers from your slides with company names or logos. If your company sponsored, they are getting great placements elsewhere. Our emcees are going to do a thorough job of introducing you, your work, and your employer(unless you want us to omit some portion of that). 

* Please please please let us know how you are doing (and feeling!). We really do want to hear it! 

Sincerely, 
[orgnaizers]
