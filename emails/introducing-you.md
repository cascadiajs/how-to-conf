To continue hyping [conf], we'd like to publish a short interview to (re-)introduce you to the community. This is entirely optional, and there's no "due" date, but we would truly appreciate it. If you'd like to be featured, please answer any or all of the following:
 
- Can you give us a Twitter-length introduction to you and your talk?
- (If local:) As a [Cascadian], what's your favorite local activity?
- (Otherwise:) Is this your first trip to the [Pacific Northwest]? Do you have other plans for your trip?
- What does your usual work day look like?
- Who in the industry consistently blows you away with wonderful work?
- Have you worked in industries other than the web?
- What does your dream job look like?
- Do you knit, play the banjo, make beer, climb rocks or do anything that isn't on a computer?
- Is there anything else you'd like us to know about you?
